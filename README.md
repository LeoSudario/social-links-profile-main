Social Link Profile Component

This project is a simple profile card layout that displays the information of a person (in this case, Jessica Randall), along with links to her social media profiles. It was designed as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge.
Project Overview

The profile card includes a profile picture, personal details (like location and occupation), a short bio, and buttons linking to various social media platforms (Github, Frontend Mentor, Linkedin, Twitter, and Instagram).
File Breakdown:

    index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure and content for the profile layout.
    style.css: The external stylesheet (linked here) for styling the page (assumed to be linked, but not provided in this code snippet).

Features:

    Profile Information: Displays the name, location, and short bio of the user.
    Social Media Links: Includes buttons linking to Github, Frontend Mentor, Linkedin, Twitter, and Instagram. These buttons are placeholders and can be linked to the actual URLs for the respective platforms.
